# AI-STATE.md — VPP Website
# Dynamic execution state for the VPP website repo.
# Records what agents have done and the current state of the repo.
# Does NOT direct strategy or prioritize next work — that happens outside this file.
# Exact HEAD comes from git. AI-STATE.md records execution state as of its last update.
# This file wins over stale chat memory for project status.
# Last meaningful update: 2026-05-23

## DECISIONS LOG
(Append-only. Agents do not delete prior entries.)

- 2026-05-23: Adopted three-file agent coordination system
  (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / AI-STATE.md) replacing duplicated CLAUDE.md and
  AGENTS.md. Codex reviewed and approved via two-round review. Merged in
  PR #19 as commit 45f3357.
- 2026-05-23: Swapped commit order to C (analytics) before B (blog) during
  three-commit working-tree cleanup because BlogEstimateForm imports from
  analytics.ts. Both intermediate commits typecheck cleanly.
- 2026-05-23: Isolated favicon fix from pre-existing Stream B+C changes
  using file-swap staging technique. One defect per commit discipline.
- 2026-05-23: Created OG social card via HTML template + headless Chrome
  screenshot approach. Source photo: frame_002.jpg from IMG_9262-frames
  (bathroom vanity, real VPP work). Headline positioned room-neutral
  ("Cabinet Refinishing in the East Valley") to accommodate future
  multi-room hero rotation feature. Trust line uses Cream-50 #FAF6EC;
  Terracotta #C24A22 reserved for separator graphic accents per WCAG
  contrast rules in brand guidelines. Added a cropped transparent logo helper
  for the reusable template because the verified source logo PNG is padded and
  opaque.

## KNOWN HAZARDS

- src/app/layout.tsx is a high-traffic file. Multiple agents have edited it
  recently. Treat as Level 1 gate (propose patch before writing).
- public/cabinet-content/ and public/social-proof/ are gitignored — files
  there will NOT deploy to Vercel. Do not reference these paths in code.
- docs/VPP_BrandIdentity_v4_0.html and docs/VPP_LogoSystem_v4_0.html are
  stale and must not govern audits. Flag if referenced.
- public/favicon.svg is 1.04MB (embedded raster). Works but wasteful.
  Do not remove without Ricardo's approval.
- The 3 blog posts in src/content/blog/ have not been QC'd for pricing
  accuracy or fabrication. Treat as unverified content.
